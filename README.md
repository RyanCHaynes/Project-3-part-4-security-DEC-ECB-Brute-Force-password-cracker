3) “secret.pdf.enc2” is an encrypted pdf file encrypted by the DES-ECB encryption algorithm. “enc2.c” is the source code of encryption, and “dec2.c” is the source code of decryption. Now, make a program to crack the key of the encryption using the brute force method. You need to test and make sure the program can decrypt a DEC-ECB encrypted file.
